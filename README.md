goal: train a model that is superhuman at bonk.io using RL (usually 1v1 but
maybe more?) self-play. at least for a basic gamemode like flat Classic. ideally
with bouncy platforms too, and ideally Arrows

motivation: bonk is a good reference because I'm beyond cracked at it. literally
unironically #1 global in arrows if I'm on a good network and good PC with no
900 ms input lag

so I can quickly tell if the model is good at all. if it destroys me then it has
likely hit optimal
